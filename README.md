Welcome to the Test Case Design Repository, where we explore and practice the fundamentals of test case design. This repository aims to provide comprehensive resources and examples to understand the importance and implementation of effective test case design.

## Project Overview

[![Project Overview](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Overview-Test%20Case%20Design-blue?style=for-the-badge)]()

This repository serves as a learning resource for test case design techniques, methodologies, and best practices. It covers various aspects of software testing to ensure robust and reliable applications.

## What are Test Cases?

[![What are Test Cases?](https://img.shields.io/badge/What%20are%20Test%20Cases-Detailed-green?style=for-the-badge)]()

Test cases are detailed specifications that define the inputs, execution conditions, and expected results to validate the functionality of software systems. They are essential in verifying that the software behaves as expected under different scenarios.

## What is Test Case Design?

[![What is Test Case Design?](https://img.shields.io/badge/What%20is%20Test%20Case%20Design-Process-yellow?style=for-the-badge)]()

Test case design is the process of creating and structuring test cases to effectively test software applications. It involves understanding requirements, identifying test conditions, and outlining steps to validate each functionality.

## Why is Test Case Design Important?

[![Why is Test Case Design Important?](https://img.shields.io/badge/Why%20is%20Test%20Case%20Design%20Important-Critical-red?style=for-the-badge)]()

Effective test case design is critical because it:
- Ensures comprehensive test coverage of software functionalities.
- Identifies defects early in the development lifecycle.
- Provides a structured approach to testing, improving efficiency.
- Facilitates regression testing and maintenance of software quality.

## When to Design Test Cases?

[![When to Design Test Cases?](https://img.shields.io/badge/When%20to%20Design%20Test%20Cases-Timeline-orange?style=for-the-badge)]()

Test cases should be designed:
- During the requirements gathering phase to align testing with development.
- Before coding begins to anticipate and prevent potential issues.
- Throughout the development cycle to adapt to changing requirements and functionalities.
